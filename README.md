# EcoBuild üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Elixir

### Team Members
- Team Lead: Kevin Paulson - CUSAT
- Member 2: Ahmed Sultan - CUSAT

### Project Description
EcoBuild is a grid-based ecosystem simulator where creatures wander randomly, drink water when thirsty, and (in the planned version) search for vegetation when hungry. The environment is procedurally generated with land, water, and vegetation that spawns over time.

*(Note: The project is currently incomplete ‚Äî only wandering, water detection, and drinking are functional. Hunger, food search, and other advanced behaviors are planned.)*

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
There aren‚Äôt enough meaningless simulations of pixel creatures living their tiny digital lives without purpose.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We‚Äôre solving this by making a completely unnecessary simulation where creatures simply wander, drink water, and will eventually eat food ‚Äî all for fun.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- **Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks:** Pygame
- **Libraries:** NumPy, heapq
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git

For Hardware:
- None ‚Äî software-only project

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecobuild.git
cd ecobuild
pip install pygame numpy

# Run
python ecobuild.py

## Project Status
**Currently implemented:**
- Procedural map generation (land/water)
- Vegetation spawn system
- Creature wandering
- Basic thirst and drinking behavior
- A* pathfinding algorithm present (not yet integrated with hunger system)

**Planned features:**
- Hunger system with food detection
- Fully functional A* pathfinding to food and water
- Creature states (Idle, Hungry, Thirsty, Eating, Drinking)
- Vegetation growth/spread and depletion
- Creature reproduction and natural death
- UI to display hunger/thirst levels
- Player interaction to add/remove creatures and resources

### Project Demo
